                <p>> Charles was born on 19 June 1834 in Essex, England.</p>
                <p>> He was a Calvinist and held a Reformed Baptist theology, but when asked about his creed, he famously replied: <strong><em>"It is Jesus Christ".</em></strong></p>
                <p>> He is often called the "Prince of Preachers", but in addition to preaching, he also wrote hymns and published a hymnal called <em>Our Own Hymn Book</em>, and he was probably the creator of the <em>Wordless Book</em>, an evangelism booklet containing no words.</p>
